# RefArch Implementation Plan - Phase 1

## 1. Foundation 
- [x] Set up Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, and Shadcn UI
- [ ] Implement TOML parsing utilities for architecture blueprint files
- [x] Create basic application layout and navigation

## 2. Configuration Panel 
- [ ] Design and implement configuration panel UI
- [ ] Build layer/category selection components based on architecture blueprint
- [ ] Create component toggles for all architecture layers
- [ ] Implement application naming and description functionality

## 3. Canvas Visualization 
- [ ] Integrate React Flow for architecture diagramming
- [ ] Create node templates for component types across layers
- [ ] Implement canvas navigation (zoom, pan) and layout algorithms
- [ ] Design collapsible application containers and component grouping

## 4. Core Features 
- [ ] Build bidirectional integration between configuration panel and canvas
- [ ] Implement TOML file import/export functionality
- [ ] Add multi-application support with shared components
- [ ] Create relationships between interdependent components

## 5. Polish & Deployment 
- [ ] Optimize performance for complex architectures
- [ ] Implement responsive design and error handling
- [ ] Add documentation for users and developers
- [ ] Deploy Phase 1 application

## Key Technical Considerations
- [ ] Use Zustand for state management across components
- [ ] Implement component virtualization for performance
- [ ] Focus on intuitive UX with clear visual feedback
- [ ] Ensure architecture blueprint structure is fully represented
